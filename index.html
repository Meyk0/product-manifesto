    <h1>The Product Leader's Manifesto</h1>

    0. **Launching vs Landing**
    Like rockets, launching a product is just the start – landing is the hard part. 
    Anyone can launch with enough thrust, but successful landing requires constant adjustments, monitoring, 
    and dedication to stick the landing. Focus on sustainable success over flashy launches.

    1. **Action Reveals Truth**
    Ship to learn, measure to grow. Don't design experiments to prove yourself right – 
    build them to surface uncomfortable truths. Real insights come from embracing failure, not confirming beliefs.

    2. **Lead with Empathy, Not Authority**
    A great product leader is like a skilled tour guide – deeply knowledgeable but humble enough to adjust 
    based on team and user needs. Build trust through understanding, not command, and remember we succeed 
    or fail as one team.

    3. **High-IQ Problems Need In-Person Collaboration**
    Critical product decisions and complex problem-solving demand in-person collaboration. While remote 
    work is powerful for execution, nothing replaces the energy and rapid iteration of a team working face-to-face 
    on thorny challenges.

    4. **Details Are Not Details**
    They make the product. Every interaction, every pixel, every millisecond of latency matters. 
    Excellence in product building comes from obsessing over the small things that others dismiss as insignificant.

    5. **Stay Curious, Always**
    The best product leaders are endlessly curious—about their users, markets, teams, and technologies. Curiosity fuels innovation.

    6. **Think Big, Execute Small**
    Hold a grand vision that inspires the team, but validate it through small, measurable experiments. 
    Each minor victory should validate or challenge assumptions about the bigger picture.

    7. **First Principles Over Assumptions**
    Break down complex problems to their fundamental truths and rebuild from there. Challenge every assumption, 
    especially when entering new markets or building novel solutions.

    8. **Frameworks Are Overrated**
    Frameworks help you think and communicate, but they won't solve your problems. No framework will tell you 
    what product to build or what features matter – that comes from understanding users and solving real problems.

    9. **Radical Candor Builds Great Products**
    Foster an environment where feedback is direct, immediate, and constructive. Sugar-coating feedback 
    or avoiding difficult conversations only leads to mediocre products.

    10. **Solve Problems, Not Requests**
    Listen deeply to problems, not just feature requests. Every feature should reduce complexity in users' lives – 
    if you can't explain how in one sentence, rethink it.

    11. **Build Learning Systems**
    Create processes that turn individual insights into organizational knowledge. Document decisions, 
    share learnings openly, and make knowledge accessible to everyone.

    12. **Speed Through Focus**
    Move fast by doing less, better. Ruthlessly prioritize based on first principles and core user needs 
    rather than trying to solve every problem at once.

    13. **Build Yourself Out of the Equation**
    Your greatest achievement is building a team that no longer needs you. Empower others, foster leadership, 
    and create systems that ensure your impact lasts beyond your tenure.

    14. **Strong Opinions, Weakly Held**
    Have conviction in your product decisions but remain intellectually humble. The best product leaders combine 
    decisive action with the flexibility to change course when evidence demands it.

    15. **Culture Eats Strategy**
    The strongest product strategy will fail without the right culture. Build teams that embrace accountability, 
    celebrate learning, and aren't afraid to challenge the status quo.

    16. **Revenue Is a Feature**
    Great products solve real problems in sustainable ways. Don't separate business model decisions from product decisions – 
    they're inherently interconnected and should be designed together.
